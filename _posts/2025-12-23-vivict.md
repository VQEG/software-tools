Vivict is an in-browser application designed for subjective evaluation of visual quality across different video encodings of identical source material.

Key features include side-by-side video comparison with a mouse-following split divider, support for HLS and MPEG-DASH streaming formats, local file and URL-based video loading via drag-and-drop, and extensive keyboard shortcuts for playback and view manipulation. The tool also provides pan, zoom, and timeshift capabilities between videos, plus full-screen viewing mode.

Supported formats include MP4, HLS playlists, and MPEG-DASH containers with H.264, H.265 (Safari), and AV1 (Firefox) codecs. Works in Chrome and Firefox browsers.
