ITU-T Rec. P.1203 is the world's first standard for measuring the Quality of Experience of HTTP Adaptive Streaming services.

P.1203 has been trained and validated on over a thousand video sequences, rated by human subjects, in order to deliver the best possible prediction of QoE for transmissions that contain initial loading, stalling, and quality variations.

This evaluation software implements the following standards:

- ITU-T Rec. P.1203: Parametric bitstream-based quality assessment of progressive download and adaptive audiovisual streaming services over reliable transport
- ITU-T Rec. P.1203.1: Parametric bitstream-based quality assessment of progressive download and adaptive audiovisual streaming services over reliable transport - Video quality estimation module
- ITU-T Rec. P.1203.2: Parametric bitstream-based quality assessment of progressive download and adaptive audiovisual streaming services over reliable transport - Audio quality estimation module
- ITU-T Rec. P.1203.3: Parametric bitstream-based quality assessment of progressive download and adaptive audiovisual streaming services over reliable transport - Quality integration module

The software is written in Python.
