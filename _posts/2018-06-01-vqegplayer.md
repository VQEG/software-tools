VQEGPlayer is a software for performing subjective video quality experiments for Windows 7 in 64bit. More recent versions may work with adaptations.

It is designed to present a video on a computer screen synchronized with the refresh signal of the display to allow for perfectly repeatable output if the PC system allows for sufficient performance. This is implemented using DirectX. It will also handle the interaction with the user to collect the quality ratings and randomization of the presentation orders of the video clips. Audio playback is not yet supported.

It was originally written by Kjell Brunnström, Acreo Swedish ICT AB, and released as freeware under the name of AcrVQWin (www.acreo.se/acrvqwin) (Jonsson and Brunnström, 2007) after it was used as the video quality experiment playback software in the VQEG Multimedia project(VQEG, 2008). This was at the time the largest subjective test ever undertaken by VQEG, involving 13 organizations that performed subjective testing for the test and in total 41 subjective experiments. These 41 subjective experiments included 5320 processed video sequences and were evaluated by 984 viewers. The software proved to be very stable and very few problems were reported. This version implemented the standardized procedure Absolute Category Rating (ACR)(ITU-T, 1999).

Later it has been further developed by Acreo and by IRCCyN, (Institut de Recherche en Communications et Cybernétique de Nantes) at the University of Nantes for various purposes e.g. 3D TV and Paired Comparison experiments using standalone and remote interfaces. It is now a versatile software for subjective video quality experiments. As such it has been used in various subjective experiments including the “Coding and Spatial Degradations” (COSPAD) and the “Ground Truth Quality of Experience 3D 1” (GroTruQoE3D1) experiment of VQEG’s 3DTV group.
