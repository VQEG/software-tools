This software introduces losses to a pcap capture file using a 2-state or 4-state Markov model. The Markov models can either be parameterized in detail or through default values. For the use in subjective tests the tool has been extended such that it will prohibit either the start, the end of the capture file or both for X amounts of milliseconds from being impaired.
