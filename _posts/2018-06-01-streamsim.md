StreamSim is a useful tool which is able to encode raw video material with different settings and stream the encoded results via pre-defined network configurations in order to insert packet loss resp. delay/jitter. The transmitted videos are decoded back and can be used to compare with the original video. It is also possible to insert the loss behaviour offline, without streaming the content over a physical network.
