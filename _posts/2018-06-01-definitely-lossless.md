DEFINITELY LOSSLESS provides a solution to reliably transmit video data from one location to another. DEFINITELY LOSSLESS simplifies the manipulation of YUV422 video data embedded in AVI files with UYVY422 Four-CC code. It also checks for truncation and correct reconstruction of the uncompressed video at the receiving side.
