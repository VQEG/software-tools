VQone, a graphical experiment builder, is written as a MATLAB toolbox, developed for image and video quality ratings. VQone contains the main elements needed for the subjective image and video quality rating process. This includes building and conducting experiments and data analysis. All functions can be controlled through graphical user interfaces. The experiment builder includes many standardized image and video quality rating methods. Moreover, it enables the creation of new methods or modified versions from standard methods.

VQone is distributed free of charge under the terms of the GNU general public license and allows code modifications to be made so that the program’s functions can be adjusted according to a user’s requirements.

VQone is available for download from the [project page](http://www.helsinki.fi/psychology/groups/visualcognition/).
