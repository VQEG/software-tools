## Video quality metrics toolkit: An open source software to assess video quality

Video content on the Internet continues to grow. As a result, streaming platforms must ensure a certain level of quality when preparing their content. To this end, several metrics have been developed by the research community to evaluate video quality. This work integrates 14 video metrics and the SI-TI indicators into a container image to create a cross-platform tool, VQMTK. The tool offers a web interface and a Bash script that combines all metrics into a single tool. Performance tests have demonstrated that the tool is capable of handling all the integrated metrics using 4K video samples. The tool can be used in scientific and educational environments.

The repository describes a container that includes the artifacts to compute 14 video quality metrics and the SI/TI indicators. The container includes Jupyter notebooks to show how to compute each metric. Besides, a command line interface script is included. This script allows the computation of a combination of metrics and can be integrated in any processing pipeline.
