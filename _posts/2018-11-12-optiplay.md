OptiPlay is a command line video player for Windows PC which reads a video file from a fast PCIe SSD and plays it back via a DeckLink video playback card from Blackmagic Design. The DeckLink card has a HDMI output which has to be connected to a HD or UHD TV. OptiPlay has to be invoked with a matroska file as argument which contains uncompressed video and pcm audio.
