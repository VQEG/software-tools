Vivict++ is a desktop application for subjective visual quality comparison between different encodings of the same video source. It enables side-by-side video analysis with an interactive split-screen interface controlled by mouse movement.

Key features include support for any format/codec supported by FFmpeg, video filtering with FFmpeg filters applied independently to either video, hardware acceleration (CUDA, VAAPI), and quality metrics plotting for bitrate, frame size, and VMAF. The tool provides flexible playback with frame-stepping, variable speed control, and seek functionality.

Available on Linux (Snap), macOS (Homebrew), and Windows (installer).
