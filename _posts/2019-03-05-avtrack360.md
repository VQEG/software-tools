This repository contains AVTrack360, a tool for recording the 3 rotation angles Pitch/Yaw/Roll around the 3 Axes X/Y/Z while a user is watching an omnidirectional video via an HMD. The recorded data can also be evaluated using tools included in this software. A dataset of 48 people (25 female, 23 male subjects) watching 20 different omnidirectional videos with 30 s duration is also included. The Simulator Sickness Questionnaire Scores obtained from subjects after every session are also included. Additionally, it contains the free available Whirligig 360° player.

Before the actual use, respective HMD drivers and software need to be installed. Additionally, playlists have to be created and the respective necessary Python dependencies need to be installed.
