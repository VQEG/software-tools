Mobile-AVRate (iOSAVRate) is an iOS application designed for conducting subjective audio/visual quality assessments on mobile devices. It can function either as a remote interface for AVRate desktop software or as a standalone testing application.

Key features include video playback via the system video player on iOS devices or remote computers, subjective rating capabilities using sliders or clickable buttons, and timing detection for keyboard input assessments. The app supports both standalone mode for independent operation and remote interface mode connecting to AVRate desktop software. Results can be exported via email from mobile devices.

Configuration requires AVRate desktop software; the iOS app receives settings and playlists from a desktop instance running on a local network.
