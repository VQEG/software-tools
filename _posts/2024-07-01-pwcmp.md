This is a set of Matlab functions for scaling pairwise comparison experiment results based on Thurstone's model V assumptions.

The main features:

* The scaling can work with imbalanced and incomplete data, in which not all pairs are compared, and some pairs are compared more often than others.
* Additional priors reduce bias due to the non-linear nature of the problem.
* Outlier rejection to screen observers that perform differently than the rest.
* The code can compute confidence intervals using bootstrapping.
