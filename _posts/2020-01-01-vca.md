An open source video complexity analyzer for predicting spatial and temporal complexity at frame, segment, and video level.

Features:

- Spatial complexity (E) and temporal complexity (h) per frame
- Brightness (L) measurements
- Chroma statistics for U and V components
- Shot detection with CSV output
- Per-block results exportable to YUView visualization format
- Configurable block sizes (8/16/32 pixels)
- SIMD-optimized for performance

Use cases:

- Per-title encoding parameter optimization
- Adaptive video streaming workflows
- Green video complexity analysis for efficient encoding

Input formats:

- Raw YUV
- Y4M
- Pipe from FFmpeg via stdin

Installation:

Build from source using CMake, or use the provided Docker container.
