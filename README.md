# VQEG Software Tools Website

Author: Werner Robitza

Go to [https://vqeg.github.io/software-tools/](https://vqeg.github.io/software-tools/) to view the site.

## Development

Install Ruby 3.2 or higher, then in this directory:

```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve -l --config _config.yml,_config.dev.yml
```

The `-l` flag enables live reloading.

## Theme

This site uses a custom Jekyll theme based on the VQEG brand guidelines. The theme files are located in:

- `_layouts/` - Page layouts (default, single, home, archive, tool, categories, tags)
- `_includes/` - Reusable components (header, footer, head, search)
- `_sass/` - SCSS stylesheets
- `assets/css/main.scss` - Main stylesheet entry point
- `assets/js/` - JavaScript files including search functionality

### VQEG Brand Colors

- **VQEG Blue**: `#003366` - Primary brand color
- **VQEG Red**: `#D63E04` - Accent color (used for underlines, highlights)
- **Dark Blue**: `#001D3A` - Buttons, footer background

### Search

The site includes client-side search powered by [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/). The search index is automatically generated by Jekyll from `search-data.json` - **no manual maintenance required**. Every time the site is built, Jekyll regenerates the search index from all posts.

## Updating Dependencies

If there are any updates needed, you can update the Gems with:

```bash
bundle update
```

This will install, among others, security updates. After updating, commit and push the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`.

## Checking Links

Install [GNU Parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) and run:

```bash
grep -hriE '(external_link:|direct_download_link:)' _posts/*.md | cut -d ":" -f2- | parallel --trim l --timeout 5 "curl -L -o /dev/null --silent --head --write-out '%{url_effective} %{http_code}\n' {}" 2>/dev/null | grep -v 200
```

This will print all non-200 links, which includes broken links or other errors. FTP is currently not supported.

## Validating Frontmatter

To validate all post frontmatter locally:

```bash
pip install pyyaml
python .github/scripts/validate_frontmatter.py
```

This is also run automatically on pull requests and pushes to master.
