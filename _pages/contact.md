## How do I contribute?

To get your tool added, please [**fill out this Google form**](https://forms.gle/Kr6rdcubyJYzzbAx6).

If you want to contribute directly via GitHub, you can also:

- [Create an issue](https://github.com/vqeg/software-tools/issues/) and suggest a tool to be added.
- [Fork this repository](https://github.com/vqeg/software-tools/fork) and add your own tool in the `_posts` folder. Look at the other tools to see how the syntax works. After committing to your fork, create a *Pull Request*.

Feel free to contact the co-chairs and site maintainers in case you would like to add or recommend other software tools to be added to the Tools and Subjective Labs Setup website:
