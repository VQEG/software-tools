# Guides

This page will serve as a collection of resources for setting up subjective tests and performing video quality experiments.

A good starting point is the Wikipedia entry on [subjective video quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_video_quality).

If you would like to contribute, please [contact us](../contact).
